## Lil' Intro

Good tidings! This is Rajiv, a PhD student in the CompSci department at Duke. Here, I work with <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~reif/">Prof. John Reif</a> in the field of Natural Computing (<a href="https://www.dna.caltech.edu/DNAresearch_perspective.html">huh?</a>). Some sane people refer to this field as DNA Computing, as we use synthetic DNA molecules to create molecular-scale computational devices. Can we make them to be modular, self-sufficient systems? That is the question. 
When I am not worried about my future, I like to play chess/badminton, read classical literature, and watch movies. I occasionally write poems and stories <a href="https://rajivteja.wordpress.com/"> here</a>.

**PSA:** If you are a prospective graduate student applying for PhD programs in Computer Science I highly recommend reading <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf"> The Gradschool
Talk by Prof. Mor Harchol-Balter</a>. 

## Research Interests

- **BioMolecular Computing:** what is the information processing capability of a bag of reacting molecules?
- **Chemical Learning:** branching off from the above topic, can we build adaptive molecular systems that can operate autonomously?
