<p>This is one of the many wonderful things taught to me by my Mom.</p>
<p>With that said, <strong>Get ready for some rainbow viewing. Its pretty simple actually.</strong><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Equipment : </strong>China dish, Water and  a broken mirror piece.</p>
<p><strong>How to do it ? </strong></p>
<p>Choose a white wall in your house. See to it that the wall gets the minimum light possible. Now put the china dish on the floor or on a chair and fill it with water. Now you have to acquire a broken mirror whose height should be greater than the level of water in the China dish. Put the mirror gently into the water with the non-silvered side facing the wall. You should see to it that enough light is incident on the mirror.</p>
<p>Allow the water to settle down. Now you may experience that the mirror will be slipping into the water. Put a few pebbles inside the dish to stop the mirror from moving. If the pebble has a little bit of mud to it, it might as well help (Mud particles might help in the scattering and dispersion of light which are the principles involved in the formation of a Rainbow. Enough Physics.xD ). So don't polish it before putting it in the water. Too much mud hinders the formation. Too much of anything is not good for progress.</p>
<p>All is done. Now all you have to do is wait for a Parachute shape formed on the wall with Rainbow colours. VIBGYOR it is.</p>
<p>I used to do this every time I bunked my school. :)</p>
<p><strong>What is happening here ? o_0</strong></p>
<p>I don't want to go all technical here, but I'll explain as simply as possible.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we know that sun light is made of seven colours., thanks to Sir Issac Newton. Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red. A colour is distinguished by its wavelength. So, obviously all these colors have different wavelengths.(Noted!)</p>
<p>The colors are acronym-ed as VIBGYOR. Thought it was a weird term like the others during my physics class :)</p>
<p>So as the light ray hits a water droplet innocently sitting on green grass, it gets scattered (separated into seven colors) due to a phenomenon called refraction that operates on the differences in their wavelength.</p>
<p>So you need refraction* to take place to see a rainbow. For refraction, you need two separate media. Thats why you can see rainbows after rain only in places that have grass lands, Remember! we need two media.</p>
<p>Same principle applies in my little trippy experiment. Water and air are the two media. Light gets scattered due to refraction and hits the smooth surface of the mirror, gets reflected and forms a cute rainbow on your wall.</p>
<p><strong>*Refraction</strong> : The phenomenon of bending of light when it enters from a denser medium to rarer medium or rarer medium (<strong>air) </strong> to denser medium (<strong>water) </strong>is called refraction. Lights with different wavelengths bend at a different angle and hence the scattering of light !!!</p>
<p>Amazing isn't it. Physics is everything and everything is Physics.</p>

<p><strong>Me and my mom learnt this together, while my dad is preparing tea for us.</strong> <strong>So I'd like to dedicate this post to both of 'em. Thank you folks, for everything. </strong></p>

<p>Shoo! That finishes my first post!! Thanks for reading. &lt;3</p>
