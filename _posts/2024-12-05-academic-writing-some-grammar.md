# Some grammar for dummies (like me)

I have learnt from my experience of reading (too few than I am supposed
to) papers, that the secret to good writing is to expand your cache of
verbs. Not to mention the correct usage of prepositions. (I can never
tell if I should write secret *to* good writing or secret *for* good
writing.)

## that+verb Vs. verb-ing

`that+verb` should be used while introducing a new subject or before a
new clause that requires qualifying a specific action being referred to
a subject. Simply put, use `that+verb` to qualify an action.

*Ex: She admitted that she made a mistake*

`verb+ing` should be used when the subject is already understood.

*Ex: He enjoys reading*

## to+verb Vs. for+verb+ing

`to+verb` indicates the purpose or intention of an action.

*Ex: He shouldn’t have joined the army to impress people.*

`for+verb+ing` describes the reason or function of something

*Ex: HE is known for singing beautifully*

## that Vs. which

`that` should be used for restrictive clauses. A restrictive clause is
something that limits the meaning of a noun.

*Ex: The song that you performed right before intermission is my
favorite.*

`which` should be used for non-restrictive clauses. A non-restrictive
clause simply supplies additional information to the noun.

*Ex: These pairs of pants, which no longer fit me, should be given
away.*

## should be Vs. has to

`should be` means less strict obligation.

- A recommendation or best practice

- A less strict obligation

- Something that is advisable but not absolutely required

*Ex: The room should be cleaned weekly* (it’s recommended but not
mandatory)

`has to` is more strict and is mandatory

- A strict requirement or necessity

- No choice in the matter

- Mandatory action

*Ex: The form has to be submitted by Friday* (it’s absolutely required,
no exceptions)

## Must vs Should

`Must` must indicate a strong obligation or requirement, often with a
rule or law involved.

`Should` indicates a recommendation, leaving room for personal choice
and indicating a higher degree of permissibility.
