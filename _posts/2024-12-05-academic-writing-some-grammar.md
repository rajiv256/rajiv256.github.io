## Some grammar for dummies (like me)

I have learnt from my experience of reading (too few than I am supposed
to) papers, that the secret to good writing is to expand your cache of
verbs. Not to mention the correct usage of prepositions. (I can never
tell if I should write secret *to* good writing or secret *for* good
writing.)

### that+verb Vs. verb-ing

`that+verb` should be used while introducing a new subject or before a
new clause that requires qualifying a specific action being referred to
a subject. Simply put, use `that+verb` to qualify an action.

*Ex: She admitted that she made a mistake*

`verb+ing` should be used when the subject is already understood.

*Ex: He enjoys reading*

### to+verb Vs. for+verb+ing

`to+verb` is used to describe why an action was taken.

*Ex: He shouldnâ€™t have joined the army to impress people.*

`for+verb` describes a reason or justification for something.

*Ex: HE is known for singing beautifully*
