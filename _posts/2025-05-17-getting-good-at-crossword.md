# getting good at crossword

I am trying to get "good" at crossword. A sure shot way of starting to do this is to do the crossword everyday. But one
would get discouraged, wouldn't one? looking at a lot of unfilled squares, a reflection into one's deeply unfulfilled
life (*mental note*: stop getting personal in the blogs!).

Right now, I can do the monday crosswords with the confidence of an 8 year old that just mastered the multiplication
tables and already aimed to become like Ramanujan. But not everyone can get the proofs spelled out by God like Ramanujan
did. All us 'Hardy' boys (it's a pun) have to actually use our polished mortal skills to develop proofs. Although
sometimes when I am solving the crossword, words I have heard and stored in the deep ravines of my memory tend to harken back to
me. Like the word 'harken' just did. Maybe, I AM special. But I wouldn't put a lot of money on that. But I diverge. 

__The Actual Post__

I am super good at crosswords from my own country.
But US crosswords seems to need some honing. (owning-honing ;)
First, I don't understand the crossword makers' fetish with the Great Lakes and the Rivers. No actually, I do. The names
themselves are enough to tickle my oratorical neurons. Rivers Missouri and Mississippi, that scrounge silently through
the great plains. Lake Ontario. Lake Erie. All these are wonderfully named water bodies. Not to mention of "The
Atlantic" or "The Pacific".  Don't the names fill you with endorphins? But yea, trivia about them are frequently used in
Crosswords, so I might as well learn them. Just to engage myself. Not to score crossword points, heh. 

#### The Great Lakes of the USA

Here's a nice picture to look at. Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Ontario, Lake Erie. I learned (and forgot) these names in my seventh grade social studies. I loved that subject but my teacher was very mid. So I blame them.

#### Trivia tidbits I boosted from my GenAI searches

- Many California cities begin with "San" or "Santa" because they were named after Catholic saints by Spanish colonists who established missions and settlements in the region. The Spanish were primarily Catholic, and they named many of their settlements after the saints they revered. For example, San Diego is named after Saint Didacus of Alcal√°, and Santa Barbara is named after Saint Barbara. _It is so surreal that I gotta describe this. I got an internship and while I was trying to brush-up on my California geography, I observed that most of the city names started with "San" or "Saint". I found it peculiar and googled the reason. IRONICALLY, this was a question in today's crossword! If this was not a sign from the Universe to continue writing this blog, Idk what is! (Image attached)_
