# getting good at crossword

I am trying to get "good" at crossword. A sure shot way of starting to do this is to do the crossword everyday. But one
would get discouraged, wouldn't one? looking at a lot of unfilled squares, a reflection into one's deeply unfulfilled
life (*mental note*: stop getting personal in the blogs!).

Right now, I can do the monday crosswords with the confidence of an 8 year old that just mastered the multiplication
tables and already aimed to become like Ramanujan. But not everyone can get the proofs spelled out by God like Ramanujan
did. All us 'Hardy' boys (it's a pun) have to actually use our polished mortal skills to develop proofs. Although
sometimes when I am solving the crossword, words I have heard and stored in the deep ravines of my memory tend to harken back to
me. Like the word 'harken' just did. Maybe, I AM special. But I wouldn't put a lot of money on that. But I diverge. 

**The Actual Post**

I am super good at crosswords from my own country.
But US crosswords seems to need some honing. (owning-honing ;)
First, I don't understand the crossword makers' fetish with the Great Lakes and the Rivers. No actually, I do. The names
themselves are enough to tickle my oratorical neurons. Rivers Missouri and Mississippi, that scrounge silently through
the great plains. Lake Ontario. Lake Erie. All these are wonderfully named water bodies. Not to mention of "The
Atlantic" or "The Pacific".  Don't the names fill you with endorphins? But yea, trivia about them are frequently used in
Crosswords, so I might as well learn them. Just to engage myself. Not to score crossword points, heh.
