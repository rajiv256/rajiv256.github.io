# Intrusive Questions and Probable Answers

#### 1. It’s raining and I am standing under a tree. I have waterproof shoes and my body is not in contact with the ground. However, my hand is resting against the tree. Suddenly, a thunder struck the tree. Say the reverberation from the thunder or the fire won’t affect me? Would the electricity from the thunder affect me? You can assume that the insulation of my shoes is very high that it surpasses the permittivity of air.

#### 2. Should tech companies acquire other companies or should they innovate? How will the world be different if facebook didn’t acquire whatsapp? Or with Twitter…(hint Bluesky)?

#### 3. Does force has a speed limit? For example, if a blackhole formed right infront of me, how long after its formation will I feel its presence.

Yes, forces do have a speed limit - they all propagate at the speed of
light (about 300,000 km/s in vacuum).

If a black hole suddenly appeared right in front of you, you wouldn’t
feel its gravitational pull instantly. Instead, the gravitational
influence would spread outward from the black hole at light speed,
creating what physicists call “gravitational waves” - ripples in
spacetime itself.

So if this hypothetical black hole formed, say, 1 meter away from you,
you’d feel its gravitational effects about 3.3 nanoseconds after it
formed. If it were 300,000 kilometers away (roughly the distance to the
Moon), you’d wait about 1 second.

This isn’t just theoretical - we’ve actually detected gravitational
waves from colliding black holes using instruments like LIGO. When two
black holes merge billions of light-years away, the gravitational
ripples they create travel across the universe at exactly light speed
until they reach Earth, where they compress and stretch space by
incredibly tiny amounts.

Einstein predicted this behavior in his theory of general relativity
over a century ago, but we only confirmed it experimentally in 2015.
Before Einstein, people thought gravity acted instantaneously across any
distance - imagine the chaos if the Sun’s gravity could suddenly “switch
off” and we’d feel it immediately rather than waiting 8 minutes for that
change to reach us!
