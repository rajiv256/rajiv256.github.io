<strong>Recap : </strong></p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Its my birthday today, Abhi. And I have been waiting the whole day to have dinner with you.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Its alright. Atleast, lets have dinner together. Please. I am starving.</p>
<p><strong>Ankita</strong> : Actually, we thought to have dinner at my place. But hey, its ok if you two guys want to eat together.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Thank …</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Its fine Ankita. We both can do that some other time. I promised you that I will eat with you and I will eat with you.</p>
<p>(The girl turns back and silently leaves, with tears all over her face. She couldn’t stop crying. The fact that it is her birthday added to her misery. “Does he even love me?” A question arose in her mind.)</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>As she was walking towards her hostel, she felt a hand over her shoulder. "Leave me alone for sometime Nisha", she said and turned back. But it was Abhi. There was sadness in his face and pain in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>I am sorry. I am really, really sorry. I thought I could do it. I thought I could act. I thought I could be tough with you. I thought I could see you cry. I thought I could let you go. But at this moment you, with a single tear in your eye,you broke all my beliefs. Today, you made me realize how much you mean to me and how sad I would be without you. I promise you. I will never ever let you down ever again. I promise whatever trouble we are going through, we will face it. Together.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>(Sobbing.) Its alright. I had a gut feeling that you were acting all this time. I am crazy enough to think that you sought the help of your friend and hid the whole time from me or anyone else outside the gates and entered the college just now to show up like this.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>You guessed it correct. Thats what I did.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : And I thought that you are smart.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>I don't want you to ruin your dreams. You might be fine with it now, but you might regret it later.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Its ok. But lets not talk about it for now. We will leave it to that. Whatever time we have we will spend that time happily. Hey!! I have an idea. Lets go out this weekend! Take me out for a long ride. Will you?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong> Me? You and me?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>No. Me and the whole crew of Frozen.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>I'd rather go alone. You guys were a far too high maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Uhh...Wait.! I am a high maintenance for you? Don't tell me that I am. Do not tell me that I am!!</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>(Snorting.) Yeah, you are a little bit high maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Ok, mister. Forget it. You are on my kill list.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Wow!! You have one? Like Arya in GameOfThrones? Who else are there?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Well, the crazy aunt next to our door who always ask my marks, that big fat girl who used to slap me, the guy who always cat-calls me every time I was walking on the road and a few others and now you.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>You are such a posh little girl aren't you. Look, It is Ok that you are a high maintenance. Because when you get upset over little things and I buy something for you that will cheer you up, it makes me happy. So, It ok that you are a high maintenance because, I like maintaining you.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>I love it when we recite dialogues from F.R.I.E.N.D.S. I just hope that we could do this forever.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Haha! We will try and try to get there. Anyways, where do you wanna go?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Anywhere. But don't take me again to Bessant Nagar beach. You are earning now so, get a bike and not a bicycle, like the last time. Alright?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong> (Murmuring). <em>High Maintenance. </em></p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>I am soo gonna kill you. If I flunk tomorrow's exam, thats gonna happen for sure. I will leave now. Bye!</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Aren't you gonna kiss me?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>High maintenances don't give kisses that easily!</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Ah!! When is this gonna stop!!</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<strong>Saturday, 7 AM. -- The Ride. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Abhi :</strong> (Frustrated) Who takes One hour to get ready?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Girls.</p>
<p><strong>Girls : </strong>Ok. Now tell me. Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Can't you wait for a while. You will find out eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Its not about that. I have to tell my dad no?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Oh that! I have already called and told him. At first he was not so ok, but then I told him that it was your idea. Then, Out of nowhere he is asking about the details of the trip.! He believes in you.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Well. Atleast someone should.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>What?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Alright. Can I ask you a question? Do you believe in me?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Of course yes. I do. Do you still need proof. (Pointing down referring to that trip.)</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Cool. Then close your eyes and don't open them until I ask you to.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>I have to, because of all this smoke. But, yeah, alright. I might as well get the sleep I missed for waking up at 5 today.</p>
<p><em>Saying that, she sat pillion and as the bike was moving at a steady pace, she wrapped her arms around his waist and rested her head against his shoulder. </em></p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>So, you actually took 2 hrs to get ready?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Shutup. I am sleeping!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(<strong>To be continued...</strong>)</p>
