<p>( I am a bit late on this due to academic burden. Sorry and thanks if you have waited patiently for this!!! This is a bit short. But I promise that the next post will compensate for this. :) ).</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">thegirl@gmail.com</span> : WoW!! Simply WoW !! I never knew that my name would mean so many things. Thank you very much. You seriously wrote this? Anyways, it is awesome.</p>
<p><u>theboy@gmail.com :</u> You're welcome. Yes and yes, I wrote it myself. And its my first !! Thanks to you. :)</p>
<p><strong>(During the vacation... In college , near CCD.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Hi! How are you? What are you doing in the college during vacation ?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Hi ! Is this a coincidence ?</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>You made me believe in that concept. !</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Oh! Sure! I am good. I am here on a project. By the way which department are you in?</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>As if you don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Ok then, I am leaving. B..</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Do you wanna have coffee? Given that we are very much near to its source.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>No, I don't drink coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Ok. Lets put it this way. When you go out on your first date, what would you like to have?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>I have no plans whatsoever, but Iced tea would be good.</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>But we can't get Iced tea here!!</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Likewise. When you guys have creative ways of asking a girl out, shouldn't we have creative ways to reject? ;)</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Sure! But definitely the next time I am gonna get a date from you.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Ok! We will see.</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>So, can I walk with you till your hostel?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Of course. You can walk on the road whichever side you want.</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>You know what, Too much sarcasm from a girl can drive a guy crazy. I wanna walk on the other side. See you. Bye.</p>
<p>(To be continued...)</p>
