<strong>Sometimes it takes water to kindle a fire.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p><strong>Place : Hotel Ritz, London, Room 256.        Time</strong> :<strong> 9:30 PM. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Rita : </strong>I always thought that London is a very small city. Never did I think that touring around would be this exhausting.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>It wouldn't have been, if you hadn't gotten a little overboard over the fact that our company is paying for all our expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Rita : </strong>Oh, just shut up. I think we have visited every single place that we had to except to the University where your girl studies. You looked as if you were suffering from constipation when we were near her University. You had a chance to meet her. When will you stop thinking about tomorrow and start living today?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Alright, you don't start now. I literally couldn't feel my legs and if I say one more word, I think I am gonna pass out.</p>
<p><strong>Rita : </strong>Sure, don't worry I am leaving. See you tomorrow morning. Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Goodnight. (Saying this he falls back on the bed and is fast asleep.)</p>
<p>Rita returns to her room wondering about his last sentence.</p>
<p>---------------------<br />
<strong>Time : 8:30 PM, Next day. </strong></p>
<p>Abhi could hear distant voices in his ears. There were police sirens. There were panic voices. He couldn't really figure out if that was a dream or for real. He has slept for almost a day now. His sight is blurry. Someone is prodding him so hard so as to wake him up. He had a huge hangover coming upon him.</p>
<p>Rita splashed water hard on Abhi's face. This made him wake up with a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>My God! Are you out of your mind? What is wrong with you Rita?</p>
<p>He wiped his face with the blanket, took his glasses from the bed-side table. What he saw infront of him changed his life forever.<br />
---------------------</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>The Headlines in the  Television ran :</p>
<p><strong>HUGE GAS EXPLOSION IN THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON's DORMITORY. REASONS FOR EXPLOSION IS NOT CLEAR AS OF NOW. FIREMEN ARE TRYING TO BRING DOWN THE FIRES AND THE RESCUE TEAM IS GETTING EVERYONE OUT OF THE BUILDING. 15 WERE REPORTED TO BE INJURED. NO CASUALTIES SO FAR. </strong></p>
<p>Each and every word echoed and riveted in Abhi's ears. His heart skipped several beats when he heard the words 'University of London'.</p>
<p><strong>Rita :</strong> University of London! Isn't that where she is studying?</p>
<p>Abhi is too stunned to respond to that. His head is reeling. All his senses are running blind. His eyes were filled with tears, guilt and regret.</p>
<p>Looking at this Rita shook him hard to jolt him back to reality.</p>
<p><strong>Rita : </strong>Abhi, we need to go there right now. They said no casualties.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Did they?</p>
<p><strong>Rita : </strong>Yes. Now grab your coat. Lets not waste any more time.<br />
------------------</p>
<p>They both took a cab and pleaded the cabbie to drive as fast as he can to the University of London. Sensing the panic in their tones, cabbie took off at once without any more chatter. The cab reached the entrance gates of the University in about half-an-hour. They got down hastily, paid him and took off towards the gate.</p>
<p>Rita had never seen Abhi this panicky. There were several security guards standing near the main gate. He ran straight towards them asked them, "Are there any casualties sir?"</p>
<p>"No sir, there are none as of now," the security guy replied and then turned towards his walkie-talkie to report the status of the situation to his authorities.</p>
<p>Abhi let out a gasp of exasperation. "But sir", the security guy said, "the rescue operation is still going on and you might want to go in check if the person you are related is fine. Show us your ID as a proof and we will take you in."</p>
<p>Abhi just remembered that he left everything in the hotel room. "I don't have an ID with me right now. But my girlfriend studies here. Please, let me go in."</p>
<p>"I am really sorry sir, but we are ordered to not let anyone in without a valid ID."</p>
<p>"But I am visiting. I don't stay here.", Abhi replied helplessly.</p>
<p>"In that case, your VISA would do sir," the security replied now being slightly irritated.</p>
<p>Rita pulled Abhi to her side slightly and whispered, "Bribe him. He might let you in then."</p>
<p>Abhi glared at her, something struck his mind. "Thats it", he said.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Rita asked. "Thats it. I mean the money. I have paid the taxi guy. It means I have my purse on me. I remember keeping my VISA and passport in my coat pocket."</p>
<p>Abhi then started frantically searching his coat for that hidden pocket. As he reached halfway down his belly, he found them.<br />
--------------------</p>
<p>"Who is there inside sir?" asked an elderly security personnel driving the car.<br />
"A woman I once dreamt of marrying," replied Abhi, still in a state of a shock.<br />
"Did you try calling her? Do you want to call her?" he said offering his mobile.  Abhi took it and dialed her number as if a typist is typing something he had typed a million times before. The call got connected and it rang and rang, with noone answering the call. He tried again. But with no luck. Disappointed, he returned it to the officer.</p>
<p>"Don't worry", the officer said, she might have left it in her room during evacuation. "I bet she is alright." Abhi managed a wry smile with those words. "Are there any casualties reported sir?" Abhi asked again. "No", the officer said, "Most of the damage was confined to the top-most floor, so the dormitories weren't that affected.</p>
<p>"I hope you find your loved one", the officer said, dropping them off near the dormitories where a huge congregation was gathered.</p>
<p>There were panic stricken faces everywhere. There were several ambulances that were tending the injured. Abhi rushed through the crowd checking near each and every ambulance but in vain. He tried asking out for her name near each and every ambulance. Just then, his cellphone rang.<br />
-------------------------</p>
<p>It was her Dad! He at once lifted the call, "Hello Uncle."</p>
<p><strong>Girl's Dad  : </strong>Did you hear about this explosion that happened in her dorm?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Yes uncle. I came to London on company business and got to know about this explosion. I rushed here at once. Is she alright uncle? Did she call? Please tell me she is alright. Please God, please.</p>
<p><strong>Girl's Dad : </strong>Relax. Relax. She is fine. She just called and informed me that she has suffered a minor elbow injury and that she is fine now. They have transferred the injured to a nearby hospital. Go at once and take care of her.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Of course uncle. Its my responsibility.</p>
<p>Within no time, Abhi reached the hospital and rushed to her ward. Just when he tried to open the door, he got another call. This time it was an unknown number. Unwillingly he lifted the call.<br />
"Hi", a very familiar voice whispered from the other side of the door. Abhi didn't know what to do. "It is her. Definitely her."<br />
There is a new life waiting for him on the other side of that door. Its just one knob turn away. Yet a part of him wanted to listen what she wanted to say.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Abhi, are you there?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Yes. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Have you heard about what happened in our University?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>I called you. But your number wasn't reachable. Your Dad called me and told me that you are fine and not hurt. I am just getting out of a panic attack. You are fine right?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Yeah, I left my mobile in my room and came outside for some fresh air. And thats when it happened. Ok, listen, there is something important that I need to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi (His heart pounding hard.): </strong>Yes. I am listening.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>This whole thing made me realise how stupid I am. How stupid you are. And how stupid our whole splitting up for PhD is. Who told you that you can't study if you are in love. Who told you that love will make you loose concentration in life. Who told you that love makes you vulnerable. Love isn't in the long phone calls you make. Love isn't in chatting all day long on whatsapp. Love isn't what today's youth claims it is to be on social media. Love isn't about seeing each other day in day out. Love is what I feel when I am exhausted after a 6 hour stretch of reading but still manage to blush when I think of the time we will be back together. Love is the strange feeling I get which tells me that you are thinking  about me. Love is that vibe you have seen your Mom and Dad sharing when discussing a trivial issue. Love is that bravery I have, that you will stand beside me no matter what. Love is not weakness Abhi. Love is strength. Its the purest ingredient on this earth which keeps life going. That is why, the moment you realise that there is noone in this world who will love you, you wish you were dead.</p>
<p>What would've happened had I died today. A broken heart can be mended but the damage caused by a crashed dream will stay with you throughout your life.  This is it Abhi. I am tired with your <em>lets struggle now for a better future talks. </em>I love you. And I can't wait any longer to start a life with you. We don't have anything between us except <em>that door </em>you have built between your irrational logic and your heart. Open that door of your heart and let me in.</p>
<p>Abhi opened the door and stepped inside. She turned towards the door and as she looked at it, Abhi was standing there with teary eyes. The heart-beat monitor showed an instantaneous spike. She laughed. She laughed, laughed and laughed. There were tears in her eyes. Those were tears of joy. Tears of joy a survivor sheds when he has escaped a major accident. Tears of accomplishment when a school kid solves his first quadratic equation. Tears of endearment when a person with a life of sorrow suddenly got his redemption.</p>
<p>She sat straight on to the side of her bed. He went straight to her and kissed her. He do not know what else to do. They kissed as if the whole universe has conspired this whole setting and this was their final moment of togetherness.</p>
<p>They couldn't really stand apart.</p>
<p>And in between that togetherness at some point of time, Abhi asked her,<br />
<strong>"Will you marry me?"</strong></p>

<p><strong>THE END.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>**The best way to get over a girl, is to turn her into literature..!**</em></strong><br />
