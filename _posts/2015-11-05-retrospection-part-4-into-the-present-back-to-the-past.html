<strong>Google Cafeteria, Mountain View Branch, California. Post Lunch. </strong></p>
<p>"That was one of the most entertaining stories I have ever heard. If you wrote it down somewhere I would say that it is a  page turner. Promise me that you'd tell me the remaining story in the evening. I just can't wait. You two would've become a great couple together!"  Rita told Abhi, her spirits raised by the delicious free food she just ate at the Google cafeteria.</p>
<p>Abhi smiled wryly, deep in thought.</p>
<p>"Hey, why are you smiling again? Is that one of those mischievous smiles you give when you are about to reveal something?", asked Rita, a bit worried.</p>
<p>Abhi never listened to that question. He was looking into nothing, eyes blinking in random succession. Meanwhile the lift arrived and they went into their workplaces. Abhi, went back to his work like a tortoise going into its shell devoid of any interaction with the world.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Same day, Evening. Rita arrives at Abhi's table. </strong></p>
<p>"No more chit chat. Continue the story.", said Rita offering him a cold beer.</p>
<p>"You should reduce your obsession for free stuff", retorted Abhi with a smile on his face that made his dimples reappear.</p>
<p>"For God sakes! Continue the story!", pleaded Rita.</p>
<p>Ok. Here we go.</p>
<p>So, all through the remaining journey we were able to converse with each other more freely and we talked about the life at our college, the academic burden and  the TV series we saw etc.., At the end I was getting down we exchanged our numbers and she even told me that she would accept my friend request this time. I pleaded her not to see the message I sent her. She agreed and from her smile I knew that she would read it at least thrice.</p>
<p>During holidays there was no stopping for the messaging between us. We literally talked all day long. We talked about the weather, the food, the future etc.,  She said that London was her dream city and that she always wanted to go there for her higher studies. I was more keen on taking up a job and supporting my family as soon as I complete graduation. This went on and on with all random stuff coming in between. Whatever it was we are talking about I was really excited as it was one of my dreams come true. I was literally on the eleventh cloud.</p>
<p>And then, the college started. Initially we used to meet on week days. But as the semester kicked in it became impossible for me to see her. So our interaction was limited to an occasional 'hi'  on  Facebook and a cursory greeting when we accidentally cross each other.</p>
<p>One day, I saw a poster saying that Salsa workshop will be conducted the coming Saturday. At once I took out my phone and dialed her number. I realized that I no longer need to search her in the contacts. I didn't know what to say to her or how to ask. I was afraid of what she would say. I was afraid that I would say something that would spoil what we had then. After what seemed like an eternity, she picked up the phone.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Hi! Haven't heard from you for a long time ? What happened ? Did you run out of pickup lines?                                          (He heard giggles from the other side.)</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Ok. Hey, listen. Umm... Would you.. Would you like... (Oh! screw it!) Hey, Would you like to go with me to the Salsa workshop, this Saturday ?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>(Long Pause.)<strong> </strong>Oh my God! I am sorry, I'd like to, but someone already asked me.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>  Oh! Hey, thats completely fine.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>I am sorry. Really. I didn't think that you would be into dance. I always thought of you as a studious geek.</p>
<p><b>Abhi : </b>Its ok. So, I will talk to you later. Bye.</p>
<p>As he cut the call Abhi kicked the nearby pole as hard as he could.(Why the hell didn't I see the poster before?) For a moment there was no pain.But slowly, he felt blood clotting in his veins and he was limping. Just then the phone vibrated in his pocket. He took out his phone and without looking at the screen,(stupid customer care people. Don't they have any other work. ) swiped the screen to take the call.</p>
<p><strong>Girl's voice : </strong>I was only kidding before!! No one asked me. I will be glad to go with you.</p>
<p>Not believing what he was hearing, he went into a total blank state. He couldn't speak a word over the phone. He was experiencing pain from the leg, joy from what he was hearing, fear from the thought that what he was hearing might not be true and amazement from the game, God is playing with him. He couldn't help but notice that this peculiar situation reminded him somehow of a certain scheduling algorithm he learnt in one of his courses!</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Are you there? I will be coming with you on saturday. Take good care of your legs. They will have a lot of dancing to do that day.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>(Mustering) Little late for that speech!</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>What?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Nothing. Thank you very much. It means a lot to me. Saturday evening then. Its a deal. (y)</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Ok then. Bye!</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Bye. (Why did I have to hit that damn pole with my leg? :/ )</p>
<p>Limping, he went to his room and lied on his bed. But we all know that he won't sleep that night!</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, evening. Salsa Workshop began. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong> Why are you moving so dryly? You have to put your heart into the dance . C'mon, step lively.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Hey! If you were in my position, you would  understand. First of all I've never been this close to any girl except my mother and sister. I never expected this to happen. I practiced all night in my room. But, right now, I couldn't feel my feet.</p>
<p><strong>Girl :  </strong>What happened to all the "confidence" that was there before? Anyways,Listen, I want to do this very badly and I would like it if you could feel free while dancing. Let me lead you. Now. Close your eyes.(Pause.) Take deep breaths(Pause.Pause.Pause.). You are not afraid of anything or anyone. Think of me as your girlfriend.</p>
<p><b>Abhi : </b>Think??</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>(giggling). Yeah. This is what we want. Show the same sharpness in the dance. And I will promise you we will be the best couple here.</p>
<p>She looked into his eyes and passed her right hand over his left shoulder. As if hypnotized, he tightened the grip around her waist and and drew her closer to him. Then they began to dance again. Initially they moved slowly as if they were absorbing the rhythm of the music. Slowly they gained the pace. He couldn't see the surroundings, he couldn't hear the music, his body felt light like a feather. All he could see were her eyes. And the only thought that stayed in his mind was "She is my girlfriend. She is the love of my life."</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong> Abhi ! Its over. It has been a great workshop. Isn't it? We were awesome. C'mon, its already late now. I am hungry. Lets go eat somewhere.</p>
<p>With that Abhi woke up from what seemed like a day dream and it took him time to gain back his senses. He nodded his head right to left and left to right. He was rapidly opening and closing his eyes.<br />
<b>Abhi : </b>Oh! Its over? Yeah. Sure, lets go eat.</p>
<p>During dinner, she couldn't stop talking about how great the dance went. She was talking something about how well they         co-ordinated, how the master had appreciated their pair ...  But he wasn't listening. He was in his own world of illusions. He was in awe and amazement that one of the best moments of his life had just happened.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>I am sorry. I couldn't listen anything. I can't explain how happy I am feeling. At this moment all I wanted to do is to ...</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>What?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Umm.. Nothing. I want to do something crazy now . Thats the only remedy to get out of this excitement. I guess I am so tired to do anything. I will go to sleep now. Thank you very very much. I had the best time of my life.</p>
<p><b>Girl : (Thinking deeply. Me too. )</b>  Stop that. I had an equally great time. You too are good at dancing!!.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>So this may be our "<strong>An evening to Remember".</strong>  huh? :D</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>You are watching too many movies these days!! :D Yes, (Of course it is!! ). And keep that humor lively.</p>
<p>So, they bade goodbye for the day and left for their rooms.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>(Why didn't I tell her today? The moment would have been perfect. May be its for the greater good. May be, if I had told now and she had accepted due to the heat of the moment, we would later end up hurting each other. May be its better   this way that we could get to know each other better. What if she doesn't think this way? What if someone else proposes her and she says Ok? No! She likes me. If she doesn't, why would she come with me. That doesn't mean that she has feelings for me. May be she is thinking what to do. )</p>
<p>With all these thoughts lingering in his mind, he couldn't go to sleep. He stayed awake all night, thinking about their future.</p>
<p>So did the girl !!!</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>"Woah!!! What happened next?" C'mon, don't waste time. Tell me what happened next." Rita pleaded anxiously. As he was about to start, the cab that carries him home arrived. Abhi told her that he was too tired to talk and desperately needed rest. "Ok! I am leaving you for now. But I won't until you finish the story." said Rita. "Sure, that way there will be someone to share...", he stopped abruptly.  "Lets go brother", he said to the cabbie. On the way back he experienced a plethora of emotions come back to him. Tears rolled down his cheeks ...</p>
