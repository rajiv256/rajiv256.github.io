<p>What is life<br> But a perpetual struggle of<br> Waking to sleep,<br> And Sleeping, yet to be awake in dreams.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Existence is a lie,<br> We just linger<br> As a puppet of our emotions;<br> Engorged into the life's fabric is this lie<br> That everyone are too afraid to deny.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A dirty veil, you so conspicuously hide behind<br><br />
Stuck in the dogma of your butchered self<br><br />
Whatever the hell that self is<br><br />
There is pain<br><br />
But you don't want to feel it<br><br />
There is suffering<br><br />
But you choose to blindside it<br><br />
Instead,<br><br />
You play with butterflies behind that veil<br><br />
And call that liberation</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You crucified Christ,<br>Gave poison to Socrates,<br>Oppressed unruly thoughts<br>And sold your soul for misinterpreted glory<br>But that's ok, ain't it?<br>Coz now, You are drowned in the sea of lies<br>flowing with the current<br>Inevitably stuck in a loop<br>Neither a thought of getting out<br>Nor a desire to</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Emotions are to blame<br>They are responsible<br>They act as your friend<br>They show false promises<br>A part of you still know that<br>In the end, all hearts are broken<br>But they show you false faith,<br>Instant gratification, occasional victories<br>To ensure you, that everything is going good<br>And in this process,<br>They suck the life blood out of you</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What is life,<br>But a mosaic of memories;<br>Untagged by emotions, You will find Order ab Chaos<br>A learned friend of mine once said<br>Consciousness is a tragic misstep in human evolution<br>We became too self aware<br>The most honourable thing for us to do as a species<br>Is to walk hand-in-hand into extinction<br>And honey, that's the reason why<br>I don't feel Bliss.</p>
