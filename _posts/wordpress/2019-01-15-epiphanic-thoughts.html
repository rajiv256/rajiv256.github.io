<p>Robins coming out of their nests, <br>Batmans going into hiding<br>Sun’s not up yet, <br>Mist hasn’t settled yet. <br><br>A paperwallah, driving through a dew-covered road<br>Whistling his favorite melody, no-one to judge<br>Greeted by an occasional team of stray dogs<br>That gave way for their well-known stranger!   <br><br>An occasional tea shop that served sparkling teas<br>Featured monkey capped men in their forties,<br>Remembering their forgotten dreams and lost opportunities <br>Searching for their one moment of rejoice.    <br><br>A just awoken homeless guy on the pavement<br>His body covered from head to hip by a jute blanket,<br>His eyes gazing the road with a known uncertainty<br>Contemplating the past or worrying about future  <br><br>As I bicycled through the misty air on a secluded morning<br>I felt so little and so big at the same time, <br>watching all these<br><br>That's when it hit me, <br>For mankind,<br>there should be moments<br>No rules, No worries, No pressures and No deadlines<br><br>So I closed my eyes and turned my face up to the sky, <br>And stretched my hands outwards, still pedalling<br>Unaware of the traffic signal that passed by<br>Because now in my world, <br>there is only Me and no one else, <br>And I was free.</p>
