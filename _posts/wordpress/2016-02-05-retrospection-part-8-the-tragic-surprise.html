<strong><em>In the end, all hearts are broken. All promises, forgotten.                                                                                                                                                                                                         -me</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>----------------------------------------------------------------------</em></strong></p>
<p><em> </em><strong>Nisha</strong> : You ok. Or are you still upset?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> :     No Nisha. I am fine. Its just that I have this weird feeling that we both are growing  apart. I don't know, he is not even interested in anything. Last time we met was last friday and that meeting was short. We drank coffee and he left saying that he had some work.</p>
<p><strong>Nisha</strong> : See, Don't overthink everything. Sit down and discuss. Don't directly jump into conclusions. May be he is apprehensive that he is leaving the college in 2 months!</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> :    Yeah, maybe. Thats why I called him now, to discuss about us. He cut it off in the middle. :/</p>
<p>(<strong>The same day, night. Time : 2:02 AM. Desolate road.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Hey, Abhi! What happened? You are too silent these days? You wouldn't talk to me.   You keep on using that phone like its your life. Whats going on? Please tell me. Lets talk and sort it out.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : What? There is nothing to talk about. I am just immersed in other jobs, thats all. I spent a lot of time with you in college so I hardly got a chance to do anything else. So, I am trying out new things.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : What did you say just now? You think you have wasted your time with me? Is that what you think of our relationship. Well done my friend. You have summarized the whole 2 years of our relationship in a single line, "waste of time". Waste of time?</p>
<p>(She cries.)</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Come on, don't take it serious! I was just joking. I just wanted to do them because I like them very much.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> :  Yeah, more than me.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : What? Amn't I allowed to do new stuff. Tell me. If you don't want me to,I'll stop doing them.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> :   I amn't asking you to stop doing new stuff. I am just saying that don't let silly things like this come in between us. You could have atleast asked me if I am interested to do any of them. I would've gladly allocated my time for it.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : See. Thats why. If you are interested you would seek it out. You don't need someone to ask you if you like it or not.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> :  Oh, yeah. This is all my fault now. You write poems for me, you waste an year coming around me, you joke with me, you flirt with me, you plan surprises for me, you call me whenever you are down for consolation and all I ask for is a little commitment and here you are paying the least attention you can, fiddling with your phone while I am talking something important about our life together.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Yes. Indeed I have done all of them because I felt like doing them. Right now, I feel like doing things alone and hence I am doing them alone. Why do you have a problem with that?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Why do I have a problem with that? What! Abhi? Are you out of your mind? You know what? I don't want to take all this on me right now. I have an exam tomorrow and here I am roaming on lonely roads past midnight with someone I thought would be the love of my life and he doesn't even care if I was crying. Thanks for that Abhi. I am leaving. Don't even mind dropping me, because I respect your new agenda to do things alone.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> :  Call me when you actually start making some sense when you speak, if that is gonna happen in this life.</p>
<p><strong>(She leaves.)</strong></p>
<p>Abhi slowly whispered into the air, <em>I am really sorry. This had to be done. </em></p>
<p>But no one were there around to hear his deep felt, silent apology.</p>
<p><strong>(Back in her room.)</strong></p>
<p>Nisha : Hey! You are crying? What happened? Did you talk to him? What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong>  : I don't know Nisha, I never saw him acting this weird. Whenever we decide to meet he would always come 10 mins before me. But for the last three times not only he came late he didn't even greet me properly. He kept looking into his mobile. Pobably he is texting someone.</p>
<p><strong>Nisha</strong> : What!! He is texting another person while he was with you? Is it an other girl?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong>  :  Come on Nisha. Thats absurd. I don't care what he is doing. All I am thinking is that our relationship is going downstream and there is nothing I could do.</p>
<p><strong>Nisha</strong> : Wait!! Tomorrow is your birthday right? May be thats why he is acting all weird. May be he is planning a big surprise for you!! Don't you think.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong>  :  Yeah!! I didn't even think about it! Yeah, may be you are true. He might be planning a great surprise for me.</p>
<p><strong>Nisha</strong> : Ok. Enough. We have an exam tomorrow. So go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> :  Sure.</p>
<p><em>(With that, she forgot everything that happened that day and with a big smile on her face, she went to sleep thinking of how her beloved is gonna surprise her on her birthday. "I will kill him if he give me ear-rings again!", she thought. )</em></p>
<p>(The next day.  Time  : <strong>12:24 AM. </strong>)</p>
<p>Nisha : Go to sleep. You can wake up when he calls.</p>
<p>Girl :  No. Obviously he is planning to surprise me. Thats why he hasn't called. I will wait for some more time. Its ok. You go to sleep.</p>
<p>(Time : <strong>12:36 AM. She calls him. </strong>)</p>
<p>Abhi : Hello! Who is calling this late at night?</p>
<p>Girl : Abhi, Its me.</p>
<p>Abhi : Oh! You, what happened? Is there any problem. Look, I am very sleepy. So if there   isn't anything important, I'll go to sleep.</p>
<p>Girl : Wait! It is important. What is the date today?</p>
<p>Abhi : I don't know. I am soo sleepy. Please, leave me for now.</p>
<p>Girl :  Its nothing important. I was just trying to make a joke (of myself). Feeble attempt. But when I told it to my friends...</p>
<p><strong>(The line cut in the middle.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Same day. Time : 10:30 PM)</strong></p>
<p>Nisha : Hey! Come on. Lets go and eat something. You didn't have breakfast, you didn't     have lunch. Now, come with me atleast and we both will go eat in the canteen. You will faint otherwise.</p>
<p>Girl :  No Nisha. He might have planned a dinner or something for me. What will he think if I don't eat there. He might think that I am upset no. I don't want to ruin the day.</p>
<p>Nisha : Ok! Alright! How about a small bite? You know, just to keep you conscious.</p>
<p>Girl : Yeah, Alright. Lets go.</p>
<p><strong>(They both eat a sandwich and were returning back to their hostel.)</strong></p>
<p>Nisha : Hey! Look! Isn't that Abhi? Who is that girl next to him? Do you know her? They are laughing a lot. What is so funny? You starving and waiting for him while he goes out with random girls all day to have <strong><em>fun </em></strong>not even caring about you? Not even remembering that its your birthday? Oh, Wait!! This might be <strong><em>the</em> <em>tragic surprise</em></strong> he had been planning the whole time. -_-</p>
<p>Girl : Lets go and talk to him Nisha. And who is that girl with him?</p>
<p>Nisha : I think she is Anita. Your boyfriend's school friend.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------</p>
<p>Girl  : Hi Abhi!</p>
<p>Abhi : Hi! What are you doing here? I thought you might be sleeping now.</p>
<p>Girl : No. I am not. But, do you remember today? Today is my birthday.</p>
<p>Abhi : Oh,  Yeah! Today it is. Isn't it. Many happy returns of this day.</p>
<p>Girl :  Thanks. Anyways where have been the whole day? I have been trying to reach your   mobile but its continuously on engage. What happened?</p>
<p>Abhi : Yeah, that. It is funny. Its actually Ankita's idea to switch off our phones so no one   would disturb us.</p>
<p>Girl :  I guess she is real funny.</p>
<p>Ankita : Yes, I am. (She extends her hand after returning from the nearby shop.)</p>
<p>Abhi : Hey Ankita. Here is the victim of our plan. Apparently she called me.. err.. how many times?</p>
<p>Girl : Fourty.</p>
<p>Abhi :  Fourty times. Haha.</p>
<p><strong>(Abhi and Ankita laugh at her mockingly.)</strong></p>
<p>Girl : Its alright. Atleast, lets have dinner together. Please. I am starving.</p>
<p>Ankita : Actually, we thought to have dinner at my place. But hey, its ok if you two guys want to eat together.</p>
<p>Girl : Thank ...</p>
<p>Abhi : Its fine Ankita. We both can do that some other time. I promised you that I will eat with you and I will eat with you.</p>
<p>(The girl turns back and silently leaves, with tears all over her face. She couldn't stop crying. The fact that it is her birthday added to her misery. "Does he even love me?" A question arose in her mind.)</p>
