<p>It was a busy Friday night on Mumbai roads, with cars, buses, and autorickshaws "synergistically" sharing the road space, while waiting at a traffic light. This created several mini "Padmavyuhas", soon invaded by over-zealous bikers. There was a hint of rain in the after hours, evident from the liquid droplets that adorned the side windows of the cars and the backseats of the bikers. The road glimmered in the brilliant incandescence of the traffic signals, high beams, low beams, turn signals, and hazard lights, as manifested by a Friday night Pinterest search.</p>

<p>Garima chuckled as she glanced at the countdown timer above the traffic signals from the back of an airport bound taxi. The traffic commissioner had recently introduced a reform to reduce honking by extending the duration to the green lights based on the noise level. She fiddled with her phone, expecting a message, while listening to her favourite old Bollywood songs playlist. Her well-judged beige and turquoise ensemble starkly contrasted her uncharacteristically mismatched black earrings. She gently tapped them while adjusting her hair, acknowledging her willful oversight. A smile appeared in her lips and gave her body a little twist.</p>

<p>As the traffic restarted, Garima checked the status of her flight and reconfirmed her terminal and gate numbers. She rechecked her admission letter into the PhD program at the University of Illinois. Her flight bound for Chicago had a pit stop at Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris. Just then, a message from Ishaan appeared, "Good morning! Garmi kaisa h?". She read it and guffawed, just the way she did many times over the past one and half years over that joke. "You are a foot and a light year more proud than you ought to be for this pun", she responded. "Anyways, reaching the airport in a few minutes," she added. Later, as she was boarding her plane, her phone pinged "Great! I will come see you once you settle down. Can't wait!". Once he sent the message, Ishaan booked a same day return flight to Chicago two days from now.</p>
