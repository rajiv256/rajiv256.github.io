<strong>Boy :</strong> Hi! You probably know me. And that is 0.75. There is something that I am dying to tell you since 6 months. This might as well be the last time I will be talking to you, so I want to tell you everything that's been going on with me.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Yeah. Tell me. But you shouldn't feel bad or make me feel bad about what you said.</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Of course not. And before I begin, I want to ask you something. I know that its NOMB, but are you single ?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>No, why ? And yes its NOYB.</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Because, what I am gonna tell you depends on your answer. So, here goes. From the very first moment I saw you in the 'C' class, I became crazy about you. Adding to that, you showed up wherever I went, not that its your fault, I felt glad that atleast we share the same interests. With this stupidity of an amateur lover I thought that we were made for each other  and all other things, but don't worry, I won't show you any of that melodrama now. I realized that it is stupid. Wherever I went, I kept an eye out for you. I didn't want to miss even a single opportunity to cross paths with you. And may I say I got mixed in the crowd. Fed up with this I stalked you on facebook. I sent you a silly stupid message asking you for friendship. Its the most embarrassing thing I have ever done and even now when I think of that I feel a shiver down my spine. I ask you here for your apologies on that issue. I would be glad if you forget the last two lines I have just said. Months passed and I still didn't find a way to talk with you. Meanwhile one of my friends violated the BRO code and made a move on you. Being the over imaginative guy that I am, you can understand what I went through. So I thought that I should grow some balls and tell you all this. I did and I did. One fine day, I was searching on the internet for the meaning of your name (you know! the stupidity.). And I found that it is "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx". And in my dream that afternoon came the first poem that I have ever written, and guess what, its subject is you. The poem was very well received among my 'Friends', you know when I say "well received". On a serious note they all said that it was awesome and I should show that to you. If someone's pushing you so hard and you want to fall it won't be very difficult. So thats what happened on that fateful day, I think you would remember. That was another embarrassing moment. I realized that you shouldn't propose to a girl infront of her friends. I am sorry for this also.</p>
<p>So this is what happened. I have saved these words for over 6 months to tell you. I am still crazy about you, but I have learnt how to carry myself and how to sort out my priorities. SO, thanks for listening so patiently. If there isn't anything...</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Woah! Thats a long speech (smiling face). I think I stopped listening right after the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Boy : (</strong>Poker face) I can repeat it as it is. I have rehearsed it like a thousand times in my head.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong> Oh no! I was only kidding. I listened everything. And you talk pretty good for what I have thought of you.</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Really ! Perhaps you should take my phone number. :D</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Didn't I just forgive you. Don't get your hopes too high. And can you send me that poem you wrote. Sounds interesting Here is my mail id.</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>(Interrupting) After all I have said, you don't think I have your mail id? And phone number too. God knows how many times I dialed your number and cut it in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong> You are a wierdo !! But you have some commonsense. So I am still talking to you. Thanks for clarifying. I really appreciate it. I takes courage to present yourself like that.</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Thank you. Thank you. Bye. I won't forget about the mail.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Bye.</p>
<p>(To be continued...)</p>
