<em>The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the loneliness of it. Memories are meant to be shared.</em></p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Same day. Abhi's apartment. Time : 10 P.M.</p>
<p>Abhi knows this by now as he took out his mobile and browsed through his contact list. As he was scrolling down he came across all the numbers of his college friends. He remembered how they all vowed to be BFFs but none of them had the time to call one another. He smiled as if he remembered a saying, "<em>On the last day of college, we all vowed to be best friends as we were then. But LIFE happened and friends became names in the contact list." </em>He couldn't stop smiling. A small tear appeared in his eye as he remembered his gang. How they used to sit in a room playing cards, how they walked together to the mess, how they all persuaded him to buy a bicycle which he didn't, .. every moment flashed before his eyes. He vowed that he would make a call to each and everyone of them. Keeping that in mind he tried to sleep. Just then he saw one more contact of a best friend. Wait! She was more than a best friend 2 years ago. Infact she was his everything 2 years ago. She was always at the top of his dialed calls and received calls back then. It had been one-and-half year since they both talked. Abhi remembered everything about that call. The time of it, the tone of it, the duration of it, things he had said, things she said, things he should've said but didn't, things she should've said but didn't... everything played in a loop in his mind. As it is always with Abhi, memories are meant to be shared. So, he called Rita.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rita : </strong>Hi there, hero. How you holdin' up there?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Hi Rita. Listen, I am feeling very down right now. So, if you don't mind, can you come up to my place tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : What? Now? Its 10:30 in the night. You know that city is not safe at this time. Anyways, I'll come. But I have a condition.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : I will provide you with free food.</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : How could I say no to that! But my condition is that you have to tell me the rest of the story. Do we have a deal?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Ooh, Bad luck. I am gonna do that anyways. You should've asked for something else!</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : You telling me on your own is one thing, but me asking you will boost me to enjoy the story more. A hard earned penny is worth more than a donated one.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Heyy! Who said that?</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : Baba Ritaji !!</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : (Quite laugh) Good. Come as fast as you can. I ordered pizza. Thanks for the effort. I owe you one.</p>
<p>(Rita comes to Abhi's apartment. )</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : Ok! Continue the story and where is the Pizza?</p>
<p>Abhi took the pizza out of the oven and so the story continued...</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>July xx th , Time 11:45 pm.</p>
<p>Abhi and his friends were busy making final adjustments to their assignment submission. They were typing on their keyboards frantically and each one of them is in the most awkward pose possible. As the clock struck 11:50, everyone stopped for a second and compressed their submission and uploaded it on moodle. The clock struck 11:55 PM, and there was a sigh of relief in the faces of everyone.</p>
<p>Abhi didn't remember that he forgot his mobile unattended in his room. As he unlocked his phone he saw 5 missed calls from her. This has been going on for a while now. Both of them have been spending a lot of time together on the phone. He unlocked the phone and called her. The phone kept on ringing with no one answering on the other side. He wondered if she was angry with him for not answering her calls. However he was confident that he could convince her as he was doing his assignment.  Everyone was hungry and they all decided to go eat in the all night cafeteria.</p>
<p>While they were walking on the road, one of their friends said, "Oh my God! July xx th is the worst day of my life." Everybody uttered an "yeah" in unison. Everyone except Abhi. He suddenly remembered something that he shouldn't have forgotten. He ran to his room, grabbed the neatly wrapped package and ran towards the Gajendra circle. "Its her birthday goddammit! How could you forget? Oh my God! She is gonna be so mad." He knew the melodrama his friends went through when they forgot their girlfriends' birthdays.One girl broke up with his friend because he said, "So, I forgot your birthday. Big deal! Its not like its the release of next Sherlock season!!"</p>
<p><strong>Abhi's Conscience</strong> : <em>"Loser! She is not your girlfriend for all that to happen."</em></p>
<p>"Yet!", Abhi told to himself and ran towards GC with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>He checked his watch on the way. It showed 12:07. He slowed down as he reached the GC. Fortunately the cake cutting is still going on and all her friends surrounded her and were singing birthday song. As she cut the cake, they started rubbing cream on her face. Abhi heard a lot of 'Awwwws' and saw a lot of selfie clicks. Abhi himself wasn't irritated by selfies but his I-hate-taking-random-pics-but-I-take-infi-selfies-in-Hyderabad friend manipulated his mind to get irritated by them.</p>
<p>Brace yourself for some "choo chweets" and "cho cutees" and "smileys-with-lipsticks-all-over-the-face" on facebook tomorrow, Abhi thought.</p>
<p>The cake that was once there no longer looked like one as there was a lot of Holi playing done with it. Slightly embarrassed to face her he walked towards her in straight strides with no movement in his shoulders. Clearly he was nervous. He hid his gift in his pocket and approached her...</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Happy birthday!</p>
<p>He took a piece of cake and stuffed it into her mouth as the remaining part of her face was filled with it. She cut him a slice and gently placed into his mouth. He thought she would rub it on his face but she didn't. He felt happy that she had that respect for food.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi's conscience</strong> : "<em>Or maybe she doesn't like you that much... :P"</em></p>
<p>"For the love of God! Be positive for one time!" Abhi told his conscience.</p>
<p>For the rest of the party he stayed back and remained silent. She looked very very beautiful in her new red ghaagra. He can't stop looking at her as she tried adjusting that little strip of hair that kept on falling onto her face, multiple times. She couldn't do it as her hands were filled with cake. Noticing this Abhi went to her held the strip with his fingers and gently combed it to the back of her ear. He heard little giggles from the nearby girls.</p>
<p>"Thanks", she said. He went back silently, partly embarrassed , partly happy.</p>
<p>Everything around him seemed brilliant. Everything made sense. The orange Neon lights on the top of his head, the distant songs of a mocking bird, the slight hint of rain with an occasional drop on his cheek, the way her bangles clinked against each other... everything seemed beautiful and in perfect Rhythm with each other. May be, poetry was born for a reason, he thought.</p>
<p>As the excitement settled down, she began to leave with her friends...</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Hey! Can you wait for 5 minutes. I brought you a gift.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : I will just go wash my face and come. <strong>Will you wait for me? I won't take too long.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Sure, I will.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi's conscience</strong> : "<em>Dude! Those letters ain't in bold. They aren't in Italics. Its just your imagination. They are just plain text. The higher you climb, the harder you fall and longer the time to recover." </em></p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : I regret to say this, but you may be correct this time. Me thinking like that was lame. But we will do what seems right for both of us, alright? I am gonna tell her that I love her and deal with it right now. This is <em>The Judgement Day., </em>Abhi told his conscience.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi's conscience</strong> : Finally you came to my track.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : No, I didn't. They just merged in this aspect and I am glad that they did.</p>
<p>So. This is it! I am telling her today! Oh my God! I can't feel my legs!! Anyways, lets practice!</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : You are the IDE that autocompletes me.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi's Conscience</strong><em> : Blah Blah Blah! Try again. -_-</em></p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : <em> W</em>hen the moon is full and waves are dull I want to take your hand and walk on the beach forever looking only into your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi's conscience</strong> : <em>Dude! Tortoises walk faster than this dialogue!</em></p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : You object to whatever I say. Why don't you put some ideas? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi's conscience</strong> : <em>Ok! Look.This is not a stand-up comedy show. This is not a romantic play some stupid guy is writing at the middle of night. This is your life we are talking about. Keep it sweet, straight, simple and honest. </em></p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Ok! She is coming back! Go hide.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi's conscience</strong> : <em>Duh!!?  Anyways, all the best dude. Remember that I'll be here for you. </em></p>
<p>(Girl Returns.)</p>
<p>As she walked on the empty road, her face glowed like an angel under the high orange lamps.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi's conscience</strong> : <em>Thats because of the cream from the cake. </em></p>
<p>"Can you do me a favor?" Abhi asked his conscience.</p>
<p>"Sure, what is it?" asked his conscience.</p>
<p>"Get out of me!", said Abhi.</p>
<p>(So, it left...)</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Whatsup? You asked me to stay back! Did you bring me a gift?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Yeah, I did. But first I want to tell you something. When the moon is...</p>
<p><strong>Abhi's conscience</strong> : <em>Not that agaaain!!! What did we discuss ? </em></p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : "I told you to get off, you are still here?" he asked his conscience.</p>
<p>He heard no answer. Turning to the girl he started speaking.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Yeah, I want to tell you something first. Ok! (Deep Breath.) Here goes.</p>
<p>Ever since I saw you, I had been thinking about you and only you. Your thoughts never left my mind. Wherever I go or whatever I do, I always wish that we cross paths with each other. My friends got bored of me talking about you on and on all the time. So, I stopped doing that which made the situation even worse. This was my position before I talked to you. However the past four months that we had been together was magical to me and never have I felt so great in my entire life. I want this to be a happiness of life time. Keeping all these in mind I want to tell you that...  (Deep breaths...)</p>
<p>that I love you. I love you for the fact that whenever I try to find the mystery in your eyes I get hypnotized by them. I love you because you are the first one I think about in the morning and the last one I think about before I go to bed. I love you for the fact that you are smart enough to figure your way out in the city alone but stupid enough to put an egg into the oven so that it'd become a chicken. I love you when you speak to old beggars with love, I love you when you step forward for each and every volunteer work that comes in your way, how much ever busy you are. I love that you never complain and I love the way your face looks when you do. I love those little strands of hair that fall on your cheek, I love the grace in your walk, and I love the good heart in your talk. I love the way your nose becomes red when you are blushed and those little twitches on your forehead when you are angry. I love every single little fact about you.</p>
<p>There is so much remaining to say, but I will stop now, so that you won't be panicked.</p>
<p>I have done my part. Its <em>over to you </em>now.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : I don't know what to say !! I have been expecting this from you. But I didn't think that it'd be this beautiful and sweet. I have only one thing to say to you. I am really really sorry. I really am. I have a boyfriend. Not from the insti. He is my school friend. So, I guess we aren't friends any longer?</p>
<p><strong>Boy</strong> : (Confused, Depressed and Disappointed. ) Yeah, I guess. See you later.</p>
<p>Saying that he turned back and started walking back to his hostel. Everything that happened in the past four months played infront of him. Every memory seemed to blur a bit. "This is gonna be a long walk", he thought.</p>
<p>Just then, he felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned back and its the girl.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Hey, What are you gonna do now?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : I guess I don't have any other choice but forget you, given that you are not at all interested in me. Its life. Failures are the first steps to success. That had always been my motto.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Ok. Thats all I need to know.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Aren't you gonna give me the gift? Atleast let me keep it as your memory.</p>
<p><strong>Boy</strong> : No honey, its not necessary. Sorry!! Did I say honey? I didn't mean to. I should leave now. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : How would it be if I were?</p>
<p><strong>Boy</strong> : What did you just say?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : How would it be if I were your honey? (She gives a mischievous smile.)</p>
<p><strong>Boy</strong> : What did you say? Is this true?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Yes, you idiot. I love you too! Past four months had been magical for me too! And when I first said no, It was just a test to know how you would react. I too have been thinking about you for the past 3 months and that question is the only thing remaining that I needed to know about you.</p>
<p>Saying this she hugged him tight. He is still in a shock and his hands aren't moving at all. Finally when she is gonna release him he moved and quickly dragged her back into his arms.</p>
<p>"I love you", he said.</p>
<p>"I love you too", she said as they hugged each other and as he finally found peace in her embrace.</p>
<p><em>He heard his conscience smiling from a distance. </em></p>
<p>Just then a security guard blew his whistle and they both separated from each other quickly. Then they both lookeed at each other and blushed, a lot.</p>
<p>Holding her hand and looking into the long canopy road infront of them and with moon glowing in the sky directly over their heads he said,<em> " Its gonna be a long walk!"  </em></p>
<p>(<strong>To be continued ... </strong>)</body></html></p>
