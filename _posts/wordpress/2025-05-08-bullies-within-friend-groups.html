<p>I don't exactly know what it is called, but a lot of people experience bullying within my friends group, although the bully tries to hide their intention as "friendly banter". Either they don't know the difference or they are masking it. It's not your task to explain. A friend group is supposed to be your safe space and where you can express yourself freely without judgement. That is an ideal situation and that's how it should be. If that's not the case with you, you need a new friend group. It's also ok to have no friends at all than being in such a situation.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Bullying usually works by poking at one's insecurities or things one doesn't typically have much control over. You're fat. You're ugly. You're inept. You're stupid. You're bad at this. These are the kind of things that have no place in social discourse. Especially when unsolicited. Maybe your humor is unique. Maybe your views are different. Many group dynamics, especially when the group is full of one-dimensional thinkers, often tend to be that way, one-dimensional, lackluster, a general wariness towards having fun conversations and banter, and the need to be self-aggrandizing. In such groups, it is not uncommon to have bland uninteresting people who are highly insecure of themselves that they tend to pit a mild outsider in the group and poke fun at his expense. Don't mistake me, I am not talking friendly banter where friends roast each other as they do in sitcoms. It's situational  roasting, like situational comedy. The situation draws the comedy and draws the roasting. It is not personal. It's not mean spirited. </p>

<p>However, sometimes, when people know that you're not the focal point of the friend group tend to treat you in a way that's less than ideal and project their insecurities on you. It happens. What you should do is retaliate appropriately. Just one sentence is all you need. Subtly expose their brittle ego and they'll crumble. Trust me, you're not losing a friend. They're not your friend. You deserve better! Take control of your experiences. Good luck! </p>
