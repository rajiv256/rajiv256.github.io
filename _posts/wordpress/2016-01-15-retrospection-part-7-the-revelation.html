<strong>Rita : </strong>What took you so long? And what the hell happened to your mobayle?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Are you doing an English accent? If you are, then its really bad. By the way, I had been busy.</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : In the bathroom?! What were you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Shut up! I was speaking over the phone. An old friend.</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : Alright, the flight starts in 15 minutes and they have announced our names. Lets go in.</p>
<p>(Inside the plane.)</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : You are telling me all these stories but you didn't even mention her name. Please tell me what her name is.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Why? So, you can check her on facebook and befriend her? Anyways, I don't want her to be in my mind right now. Once, I speak out the name, I will want to see her, given that she is in London. I don't need this right now. She is doing something meaningful in her life and so am I. So lets just let it be like that. Ok?</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : Alright. Alright. Atleast show me that poem you wrote. Can you do this or is that forbidden too? -_-</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : I sense you are angry. Ok. Let me do this. I will show you the poem. Her name is hidden in the poem. If you find it out, please don't say it out loud. Alright?</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : Oh! Looks like I got a reason to be Sherlock. :P</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Oh! You will be disappointed. Anyways, here it is.</p>
<p>(He takes out his mobile, opens that age old mail and zoomed it so that only the poem is visible and nothing else.)</p>
<p>It read ,</p>
<p><em>You are the slightest voice ... </em></p>
<p><strong>Air Hostess</strong> : Sir!</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Yes!! (Oh my God! She is hot!!)</p>
<p><strong>Air Hostess</strong> : Is that your brand new iPhone8s?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : (Proudly) Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>Air Hostess</strong> : It looks very nice sir.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Well, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Air Hostess</strong> : While we agree on that, do you know that there is something called Airplane mode in it?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>Air Hostess</strong> : Well, it is named like that for a reason. (She said, pointing around the plane.)</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : (Coming back to this world.)Oh! I am sorry.</p>
<p>He enabled the airplane mode and switched the mobile off.</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : Why did you switch the mobile off? I could've read it offline no?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : When a hot girl tells you something, you don't think. You just oblige. Thats the  rule. :P Hey!! I am sorry. I will show it to you, as soon as we land. As a compensation for my mistake, I will tell you the remaining story.</p>
<p><strong>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p><strong>(4 months later. Placement Season.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : (Over the phone.) Hey! Listen. I can't talk right now. I have the Google interview tomorrow. So, if there isn't anything important, I am gonna hangup. I am a bit stressed.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : oo! Do you want to meet? I might be able to do something about the stress thing.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : C'mon !! I am serious.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Ok! I am sorry. Hey!  You already got placed. And you told me that it is the job that you like. Don't take so much pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : But... Yeah. Ok. Thanks. See you. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Bye. All the best.</p>
<p>(<strong>After the interview.</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : So! What happened? Did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : No. I am not selected. They said I just missed it. Anyways, its a far shot. Let it be. They didn't select anyone. Thats it. I am not sitting for anymore interviews.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Look. Its ok. Remember one thing. Its not where you do or what you do that matters. What matters is the way you do. Do your best with your current job.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Anyways, you wanna go watch a movie?  I guess Nolan's movie  is in theaters. Lets go.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Alright. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>(After the movie. H.H) </strong></p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : (Thinking deeply.) Do you ever think about the future. I mean I know its too early or I might be too despo, but did you ever think about it?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Yeah, I did. Many times.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : So, you wanna talk about it now?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Ok! Since, I am in dual-degree, I still have one more year here. So, we have to do the long-distance for an year. It might be tough at times but I think we can manage. And after that I get a job and we will stabilize our careers. Then we both get married and move to the same place. Either you get a job where I work or I will get a job where you do.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : If I have 10% as much clarity as you do, I will consider myself wise. Now that I don't, I am a bit panicked. What if it didn't work out this way? I mean, your plan is really good. But there are lots of '<em>if'</em>s in it.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Wait !! Sometime back you told me about studying in London. What happened to that?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Yeah. I had second thoughts. I don't think that it is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Ok. But you are not doing it for me, right? If you leave the choice for me, I will say that you go for it and don't think about me.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : (I know. Hence the lie.) I am not interested anymore, thats all. Anyways, we have talked enough about future. Lets come back to the present.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : So, you have any plans for that too?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Yeah. One.</p>
<p>Saying that she leaned forward. He froze. She gently moved towards him. Their breaths were touching their faces and as they both closed their eyes, their lips met.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : (Smile on his face.) My first!! It lasted a whole 6 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : (Smiling.) Well, everything has a beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : So, there are gonna be more?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : You bet.!</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(<strong>4 months later.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Hey, honey. You ready to meet your in-laws-to-be?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : You sure we can do this?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Don't worry. I am just gonna introduce you as my friend. Be yourself. Thats enough.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Alrighty.</p>
<p><strong>(Enter the in-laws.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Girl's father</strong> : Hi baby. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : I am fine dad. How are you ma?</p>
<p><strong>Girl's mother</strong> : I am fine too. You've gotten lean. Aren't you eating properly?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Oh! Come on Mom. Everything's good. By the way, Mom. Dad. I want you to meet Abhi. He is my best friend.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Hi uncle. Hi aunty. Very nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : I know that you both are hungry. So we made reservations in  a hotel. Why don't you go freshen up. We will leave in half-an-hour.</p>
<p><strong>Parents</strong> : Ok. Sure. Come with us darling. Its been so many days since we've seen you.</p>
<p><strong>(Inside the refreshment room.) </strong></p>
<p><strong>Father</strong> : So, I understand that he is really not your friend. Are you two serious?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : (Smirk.) Yeah dad. Pretty much.</p>
<p><strong>Father</strong> : Is this why you cancelled your plans to go London for further studies?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Yes dad. I am sorry, but I don't want to loose him for a long-distance relationship. I am not really glad about it. I am sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Father</strong> : I know you are a grown-up and I always honor your decisions. But does he know about this?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : No dad. He will persuade me to go. He will even leave me for that.</p>
<p><strong>Father</strong> : Alright. I know that to sustain a relationship one of the two must do a sacrifice. Its your wish. Anyways, lets go eat.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Ok.</p>
<p>(<strong>In the hotel. Washroom.</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Father</strong> : So, you two serious?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : About what uncle?</p>
<p><strong>Father</strong> : No need to hide boy. Just tell me.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Umm... yes uncle. Absolutely. She has got great plans for the future. I usually tend to go with them.</p>
<p><strong>Father</strong> : What about your parents? Are they ok with this.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Yes uncle. I told them long back. However they didn't  get to meet her in person.</p>
<p><strong>Father</strong> : I am sorry if I hurt you with my words. But, do you know about her London plans? An year back she had no other plans except going there for higher studies. Do you  know that?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : She told me that she isn't interested in that anymore and told that she don't want to talk about it. So I left it like that. Is there a problem, uncle?</p>
<p><strong>Father</strong> : Do you know, why she dropped those plans?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : No uncle. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Father</strong> : For you.</p>
<p>The plane landed in London and slowly settled on the runway.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : Oh my God!! So? What did you do then? Did you confront with her?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : I have talked enough for today. I need to rest.</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : Idiot!! Atleast, show me that poem. You and your ideals. -_-</p>
<p>Ok! Here it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><em>                             </em></strong><em>You are the slightest voice I can hear,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><em>                            </em></strong><em> You are the heart of  my song I strive for; </em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><em>                             </em></strong><em> May be R love is a MYTH, so may it be , </em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><em>                             </em></strong><em> I still love listening eventhough I amn't singing!!</em><strong><em>  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Rita</strong> : Wow!! That is really nice. But you said there is a name in it. But, I don't see anything here. :O</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Well, <em><strong>Search for it</strong></em>.</p>
<p> </p>
