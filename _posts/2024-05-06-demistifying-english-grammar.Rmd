As a non-native speaker, I have struggled and am struggling (thankfully much less so) with the grammar usage or even forming proper sentences or in speaking fluently (it's possible that I don't have adequate amount of verbs in my vocabulary (it's true, look it up!)). So this is my attempt at demistifying the English grammar and to see if there is a way to read and write English fluently. I believe, putting it into words and figures drives the point and might even illuminate me about few things!
