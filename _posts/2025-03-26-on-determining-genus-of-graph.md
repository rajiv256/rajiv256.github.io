I am reading the paper “On determining the genus of a graph” and,
frankly, I think I read better when I keep my brain juices active by
simultaneously blogging about it. So that my demons are not shouting
down my better angels, if you will.

This paper tries to find a graph embedding of a graph $G$ on a surface
of genus $g$.
