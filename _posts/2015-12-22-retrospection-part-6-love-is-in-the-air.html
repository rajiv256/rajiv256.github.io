<p>JF Kennedy International Airport. <strong>Time</strong> : Doesn't matter.</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : I still can't believe that our company is sending the two of us to London on a special assignment! London is one of my favorite cities. Hey! Wait! I guess its someone else's favorite too. Huh? Aren't you excited? OOh... Do I hear reunion bells!</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : No no. I don't think so. Hey, You seem to be very high spirited today?</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : Why wouldn't I be? I am going to one of the lovely cities in the world and that too at company's expenses! Its London baby!! Nothing can get better than this.</p>
<p><strong><em>Abhi's conscience</em></strong> : My dear Rita, anything can get better or worse than it already is.</p>
<p>Abhi looked at Rita as if to say something. Just then...</p>
<p><strong><em>Airport Announcement</em> </strong>: <em>The flight BA8450 that departs in 30 minutes has been delayed due to bad weather. The revised departure details will be announced soon. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Abhi's conscience</strong> : Rita! Told ya' ;) </em></p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Do you know that British Airways had suffered the wrath of the Indian cricket fans, because they asked Sachin to send his full name and details? There were #neveronBA all over the twitter then. But now, me, the guy who vowed along with a bunch of friends not to travel on BA is going to break the oath.</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : I guess, everything fades out with time.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : Looks like we've got time to kill. Lets go back into your past again. Shall we? At this time, our current space co-ordinates are the most boring.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Don't you want me to be happy? I am not in a mood to tell stories.</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : C'mon Abhi! Who are we kidding? We all know that you want to. :P</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : You got me. Ok! So where did I stop?</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : You were holding her hand at some place you call as GC and you said that "Its gonna be a long walk".</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Oh, yeah. That was a mesmerizing time I have to say. Those first few moments really beats the coward in you, and I tell you, at that moment if you decide to conquer the world, You WILL conquer the world.</p>
<p><strong>Rita</strong> : Sure! Go on.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><em><strong>GC . </strong></em><strong>Time</strong><em><strong> :</strong></em><strong> 1</strong><em><strong> am. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : So, This is it? Is this really happening? I still can't believe it. What should I do now? I never thought about this. You know how I always overthink? The problem is that I always do that in a negative way. I have thought of all the ways in which I should get over you if you reject. But this is, you know almost unexpected. I don't know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : (Taking his hand into hers) Hey, Abhi. Listen to me. Its Ok. Its all Ok. Everybody feels like this for the first time. No one are born as cupids. And just so you know, I'll be there the whole time to take care of you.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : I am so lucky to have you. And I love you. A lot.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Me too.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : But I guess it'd be wierd for a few days for me to get adjusted. We both should've to be patient.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Well! You should. It is clear that you are a bit nervous. May be you shouldn't have proposed today. May be you should have given it sometime?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : No no. My thoughts were crystal clear. And I know what I am doing. Its just the nerves. They'll cool down! Give it time.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : (Looking at the watch.) Oh my! Its 1:30 already. You must be sleepy  after all that assignment work, no?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : No. I don't want to spoil this. Besides, I am ordering you as your new boyfriend to stay with me, here.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Woah! You have the rights to? :O</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : If I don't have them, I'll take them. :D</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Well, Well. Look who is back in form!</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Hey, shall I tell you something?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : What?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : You are looking really,really gorgeous today. I couldn't stop staring at you the whole time. I thought you would freak out. But thankfully you didn't.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong>  : Well, Thanks. They say that beauty is not about the appearance, but it is a state-of-mind. Corresponding to my current state-of-mind, your statements may not be false. And by the way, you look handsome too.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Hey!! I am serious. Why would I accept you if you are not handsome. Again, handsome is not about the looks or muscles. Its a state of mind. And I love the way your mind thinks. That made me fall for you.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Ok,ok! I agree. I am handsome.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Well now you are a little less handsome. :p</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Well, a human mind shouldn't be in a single state, should it? :D</p>
<p>(They both laughed.)</p>
<p>This went on and on. They started talking about their past.As she talked, he listened to her silently, looking at her expressions as she talked. Her voice felt like a river flowing down from a hill with added effects by the cooings of the nearby birds.</p>
<p>As he continued to look at her, she went close to his ears and whispered, "Lets go. I am so tired and sleepy." As she was retreating, she stopped midway and gave a cool peck (That was because of the cool cake I guess.) on his cheek and whispered,"I love you" and waited. Abhi kissed her back on the cheek and said, "I love you too."</p>
<p>They got up, still holding hands, and then they cut them loose half willingly and as they finally parted he took her hand and placed in it the gift that he carefully packed. He then said bye and left.</p>
<p>On the way back to her hostel, she opened the wrapping to find a pair of ear-rings. Along with them was a piece of paper. On that paper, these words were written -  <em>" When I went to  pick a gift for you, I found these ear-rings crying. I asked them what's wrong. They told me that they are ugly and no one would pick them. So, I assured them that I will find a happy place for them, where they will look beautiful. Will you help them?"</em></p>
<p><em> </em>After some time, she received a phone call. It was Abhi.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Hey! Did you take this right of calling whenever you feel like? (She giggled).</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : No. But I am taking it now! Thanks. By the way, did you reach your hostel?</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong> : Yes. I am in my room.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : "Did you like the gift? " he asked with an unknown apprehension.</p>
<p>There was a silence for sometime on the other end. After what seemed like an eternity, she replied...</p>
<p>"<em>Don't worry. The earrings found a good place to stay. They are happy now." </em></p>
<p><strong>Abhi</strong> : Thanks! Abhi said with a sense of satisfaction. Hey, and by the way, Is that happy place your ears or the cup-board?</p>
<p><em>"They are in a place, where they will appear most beautiful," </em>She said.</p>
<p>(<strong>To be continued...)</strong></p>
