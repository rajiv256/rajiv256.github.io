## Papers

\[[1](#ref-Zhang2021-ta)\]

### Main points

- Nucleic acid therapeutics are third most emerging technology and
  substrate after small-molecules and antibodies.

- Simple, fast, and cost-effective.

- RNA therapeutics doesn’t induce mutagenesis such as DNA does.

- Conditional execution have not been figured out. Most DNA/RNA
  therapeutics are delivered to their action site. Lipid Nano particles
  (LNPs) are also a delivery vehicle.

- Alternative strategy is to enhance specificity by incorporating
  computing into the circuits—triggers as ‘input’, programming
  modalities as the ‘transducer’ and the output as the ‘effector’.
