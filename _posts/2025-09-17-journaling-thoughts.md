# Journaling thoughts

`09/17/2025`

I was reading "A Room of One's Own" by Virginia Woolf and her way of words is making me fall in love with her. I read a
nice sentence where she was talking about how when authors write about dinners, they hardly ever talk about the actual
ingredients, but instead focus on some witty conversation or a quip that came out of it. Then, she proceeds to say that
she will break that convention and begins to describe the dinner. While describing wines being filled and refilled, she
instead says that the glasses _flushed yellow and flushed crimson_. Swooon.
