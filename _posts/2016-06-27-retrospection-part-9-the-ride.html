<p>The East Coast Road was empty. As the bike cruised through the ECR with a steady speed, the morning's sun greeted them with a refreshing warmth on their cheeks. She is still supporting her head on his back. She isn't sleeping anymore. Soon enough they hit the Mahabalipuram road. There were breath-taking rock cut temples onto their left and the calm and peaceful sea breeze coming from the other side. Unable to decide which direction to turn, they kept swaying their heads, savoring each and every moment.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Do you know, these temples are carved from a single huge rock.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>I too studied history in my high school mate. But it was the practice those days. The architects didn't know how to place things together into huge buildings so they used to make them with a single huge chunk.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>(Sheepishly) Oh really! Didn't know that. Who built these temples?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>The Pallavas built these. Apparently these are one of the finest rock cut temples in India. Infact this is an UNESCO world heritage site.</p>
<p>Abhi listened to everything with great caution and nodded along. He promised himself that he would think twice before trying to show-off with her. Chances are that she knows twice more than him, he thought.<br />
Waving off his thoughts... he said.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Thats amazing! Now, enough with the history. Lets park this bike and roam around.</p>
<p>As they were parking the bike a delicious smell of the Coromandal spices filled their noses. Hypnotized, they started walking in that direction. There they found a hotel. It was more like a <em>dhaba </em>rather than a hotel. But it was as clean as any other decent restaurants. The food wastage was kept at a minimum, the plates were kept clean and the food is neatly covered to isolate from the flies.</p>
<p>The owners of the hotel were a homely couple and invited them to have breakfast. Abhi inquired about the tasty smell that hit them. The husband told them that it was the effect of the home ground sambar powder made by his wife. His eyes gleamed with pride. So they ordered a plate of idly each and ate it hastily. The couple asked them how it was.</p>
<p>"The taste of the sambar surpassed its odour", Abhi said.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>So much with the words huh? She smirked.</p>
<p><strong>"</strong>You know me", Abhi smirked back.</p>
<p>They finished their breakfast and started to walk towards the sea.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>(Looking at the tides.) You know, those tides are influenced by the gravitational force betw...</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Shusshhhh.... We are here on a road trip. Not for a BBC documentary. So, shusshh. This is why Joey never dates women who read a lot. :P</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Oo.. So you want to feel like you came on a road trip with your girlfriend huh? Ok then.<br />
She passed her hand around his waist and started tickling him. He stood firm with his stimach muscles flexed. When it was his turn, she curled like those dancing trees in cartoon movies. In between the game their eyes met several times and everytime they looked at each other, their smiles widened.<br />
After their little game , they sat close to the sea on the wet sand and started building little sand hills.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Why did you pay them 500 for breakfast? I had change with me. I would have payed no?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Its not that. While I was washing my hands he and his son came to me. Apparently his son got a small job in London but he doesn't have enough money to pay for the visa. So, he decided to ask his customers for help. I verified and his certificates were authentic. So I gave them 500. He thanked me a lot and told me that he will return me the money  incase the money he gathered isn't enough. And, it feels good to help someone in need.</p>
<p>On hearing this, the girl went into their hotel and returned after 15 mins. Meanwhile Abhi started to build a compound wall around his sand villa.</p>
<p>(Girl returned.)</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>What took you so long?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>I made sure that they won't return your money to you.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Really? How?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>One of my cousins works for a travel agency who has a special deal of sending poor people like him  abroad for free and they can pay the money back as they work. I put them in contact.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Thats great. You always outrun me in every endeavour. One of these days, I am going to defeat you.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Yeah. We'll see. So, now, will the proud prince let his cute princess into his silicon castle?</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Only if she bends knee and proclaim me the King in the North.</p>
<p>She pushed him, rolled him over and then caught his legs, bent them until his knees and asked, Is this knee bending enough my dear King in the North? she asked.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Ouch! Ouch! Enough. You can enter the castle.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>You know what. I am gonna miss you.<br />
(He said in a submissive tone. )</p>
<p>On hearing this, she released his legs. Her glass bangles clinked against each other. She is trying to adjust the hair strands that were falling on to her face but she just couldn't. She sat down in one swift motion. Abhi stood up from the sand. He too was thinking deeply, not sure whether  to feel good that his face was off from the ground or he had just ruined the trip by saying what he said.</p>
<p>As she was looking towards the sea, he sat beside her, wrapped his arm around her and started to pat her shoulder gently.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Hey, Its gonna be ok. It really will be.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Yeah. I hope so.</p>
<p>So, they sat on the beach, and stared at the horizon watching the never ending cycles of waves rising and falling. It wasn't boring at all for both of them. Each time a wave comes, Abhi collects the sea-shells that came with it and decorated them on her feet. And when the wave washed out the pattern, he makes a poker face and starts collecting shells again. And she watched all this with utter amusement on her face.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>In the afternoon, as the hot sun combined with the humidity of the sea started to make them feel uncomfortable, they sat up and started to see the rock structures again.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>No more history, ok?<br />
(He tried to break the ice. "Ok!", she giggled.)</p>
<p>They clicked some pictures, solo and combined and throughout that time they were unable to stay away from each other. And when it was time, Abhi asked her..</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Where do you wanna go next?</p>
<p><strong>"</strong>I don't want to go anywhere now. I just want to lie beside you and rest. Can we head back to the cottage?" she asked.</p>
<p>Abhi obliged. So they went into their room. Both of them freshened themselves up, ordered some food and laid down on the extremely smooth coir mattress.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>I can't believe you are leaving in two weeks. Anyways, why are we both so sad? Its not like we are parting our ways or anything. I don't want to be like this. Shall we do something fun.</p>
<p><strong>Abhi : </strong>Sure, what kind of fun? ! (He asked with a mischievous grin on his face. )</p>
<p>Out of all the possible ways of fun, they decided to sleep on each other's hands. Oddly enough, they both found it more comfortable than the stuffed,fluffy cotton pillows...</p>
<p><strong>To be continued...</strong></p>
