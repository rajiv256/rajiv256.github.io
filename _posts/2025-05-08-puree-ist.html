<p>I didn't read much of modern prose/poetry, but most of what I have read has been pretty bland and uninspired. Including the ones I wrote. Granted, I only started acquiring vocabulary AFTER I failed an English exam at the beginning of my undergrad. I get a free-pass. I'd like to think it was this desire to be better that made me spend all that time watching countless re-runs of Friends, Office, and The West Wing. Especially the last one. </p>

<p>Often, classical literature tends to reach to my heart strings and puts a Windsor knot on them. Modern prose never came close. (such rhyme. I am not half bad) </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I was recently reading some quotes of Ray Bradbury, who by the way shares my admonition of modern writing said, "<em>If you step on a live mine, make it your own. Be blown up, as it were, by your own delights and despairs.</em>" Damn, how beautiful was that. And he said it in an interview, just out of nowhere. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I then went hunting for more such phrases, and as it were, I found this one, "<em>Stuff your eyes with wonder, live as if you'd drop dead in ten seconds.</em>" Such a platitude, but more than words, it is the expression that makes it great, I think. </p>
