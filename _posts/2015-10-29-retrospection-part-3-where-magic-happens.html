<p>Time :  5:15 PM, Chennai Central .</p>
<p>The woman in the announcement room boosted by her evening's filter coffee announced the departure of Chennai-Bangalore Shatabdi Express in 15 mins.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a girl, dressed in a red-black salwar kameez was trying to drag her heavy luggage on the platform. The humid climate and the weight of the baggage came crashing on to her and made her sweat heavily. Ocassionally she would stop to rub the sweat off her face.</p>
<p>"You need help?" a voice asked from behind, trying to show that he is trying to hide the mischievousness in it. Bewildered, she turned around and found a guy dressed in night pants. But its not his dress that surprised her. Its his face!</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>I suppose that you are on the wrong platform?</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>I am on the correct track right from the beginning. I am just trying to put you in track. I mean on this track. ;)</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>So, you are going to Bangalore. How come I've never seen you going there before? I heard that you are from A.P ?</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>You heard!! Woah, thats a positive!!</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Don't get so high. I just hoped that there is a good asylum near your place.</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>I amn't driving mad myself. You are the one that is driving me crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Oh my God! Why do you wanna kill a proper chat? Ok, enough talk. Anyways the train is going to start. Are you gonna help me or not?</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Of course. Zip. Lock.</p>
<p>He takes a <strong>Center Fresh </strong>gum from his pocket and begins to chew. The girl smiles as if she understood the pun.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>You are very cool when you are silent. :P</p>
<p><strong>Boy :  </strong>Had I been silent, will we be having this conversation?</p>
<p>(AC coach. Train begins to start.)</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>(Suspiciously) Oh no! The train had started. Aren't you gonna go into your coach? Wait! Are you in this compartment?</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Oh cool. We can have a nice chat during the journey.</p>
<p>A strange smile appeared on the boy's face. Somehow she felt that there is something more behind that mysterious smile. She clears of all the thoughts in her mind and starts reading <strong>The Fault in Our Stars. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Oh! The Fault In Our Stars ? You must be very strong minded. I tried reading it many times, but I just couldn't complete it. I read until the time Hazel gets a chance to go to France and couldn't because of her serious health issues. I just couldn't cope up with that :/ . So I stopped reading it.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>You shouldn't have. Because, she does goes to France!! Peter helps her to realize her dream. And then she meets the author...</p>
<p>She starts narrating the story and when she completes the story both of them can see the other's tear filled eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>I'll be back in a minute. (Goes to the rest room.)</p>
<p>As she returns, she finds that the boy had gone too. Bewildered she sat and dozed off a bit. Solitude makes time run slower. Also the sudden loneliness after such an emotional throw up is getting dumped on her bit by bit.</p>
<p>(The boy enters.)</p>
<p><strong>Boy :  </strong>Fancy a drink? (He holds a flask and two sets of cups in his hands.)  This might not be a perfect beverage to offer in an AC coach but you left me with no other option.</p>
<p>He pours iced-tea into the glasses and offers her one.</p>
<p><strong>Girl :  </strong>(Ah! Now we know the mystery behind that smile.!!) So, Is this gonna be our first date?</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Yeah, in the real world. If I were dreaming right now, this would be the 221st. Right now, I am just hoping that I won't wake up in a lonely room in my hostel.</p>
<p><strong>Girl :  </strong>(Smiling) Iced tea must've been very hard to get in Chennai? Where did you get it anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Would you believe if I said that I made it?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Oh my God!! Did you make it?? (Puts the glass down and giggles.)</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Don't worry, I didn't make it. Well, If you really need something, the entire ...</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>universe conspires to help you. You are not the only one who read "The Alchemist".</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Someone said girls are too much into their looks. But, I hereby say that this girl, sitting here right next to me is so much into her books!!</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>What a line! And, by the way you should be glad that I am not a feminist. :P</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Yeah, those who say themselves as feminists are nothing but a piece of shits whining about how society has been indifferent to them. You remember how they raise stupid and petty issues defaming famous personalities. They made me hate the entire concept of feminism. In my opinion, feminism is a bond that girls of the present society stand up for each other and protect their rights and enhance their opportunities to grow and develop in current male dominated society.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Well said ! I didn't know this side of you ! Lets not drag this too far. So tell me your book-bucket list.</p>
<p><strong>Boy :  </strong>Um, I have finished Dan Brown, The Shiva Trilogy, CB , Agatha Christie, and several classics like Pride and Prejudice,.. and The Fault in Our Stars, I just completed it today. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Pretty much the same. Except that I didn't read Shiva Trilogy. I like Agatha Christie the most among the thriller writers. And by the way, I guess there is some connection between you and cryptographic puzzles?</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>How did you know?? :O</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>I remember what you did that day. You showed your ego. And now its my turn. (Evil Wink).</p>
<p>(Dinner arrives to their coach.)</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>I just remembered something that I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>What?</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Candles! I thought that I'd buy them on the way. But, my memory sucks.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Is this the only thing you think about? Anyways, bad luck. Who knows, I might have enjoyed that. :P</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Just kidding. My memory sucks, but fortunately It didn't when it mattered. You might as well enjoy this.:D</p>
<p>(Takes out candles and lights them up.)</p>
<p><strong>Girl :  </strong>(Blushing) (More blushing) Nice move. But never lie to me again. I hate that. Find new ways of surprising people.Shall we watch a movie after dinner?</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Sure, how could I say no.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>How about "When Harry met Sally" ?</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>No, "You've Got Mail" will add more color to our context. As all this started with that mail from you!</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Yeah, wow! Spontaneity huh?</p>
<p><b>Boy : </b>Preparation is more like it.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>Okay, enough talk. Lets first finish the dinner. If there is some ice tea remaining, give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>First iced-tea, then a candle light dinner and then a movie on romance comedy!! Turning out into our dream date huh??</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>I said, enough talk !!</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Why don't you just agree with me on one sentence at least.</p>
<p><strong>Girl : </strong>If I agree to everything you say, there won't be any conversation. So, you should be thankful to me that I made your da'y'te.</p>
<p><strong>Boy : </strong>Thats partially true. And yes, this is my dream da'y'te too... Thank you. Unlike the dates I get from you in my dream, I am glad that this one has a rather happy ending.</p>
<p>Little did he know whats gonna strike them next.</p>
<p>So, they both finished their dinners without another word and the movie began. With Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan each with their individual charm mesmerising their lonely audience.</p>
<p><strong>To be continued...</strong></p>
