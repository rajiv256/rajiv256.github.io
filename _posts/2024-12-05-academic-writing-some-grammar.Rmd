# Some grammar for dummies (like me)

I have learnt from my experience of reading (too few than I am supposed to) papers, that the secret to good writing is to expand your cache of verbs. Not to mention the correct usage of prepositions. (I can never tell if I should write secret _to_ good writing or secret _for_ good writing.)

## that+verb Vs. verb-ing 

`that+verb` should be used while introducing a new subject or before a new clause that requires qualifying a specific action being referred to a subject. Simply put, use `that+verb` to qualify an action. 

_Ex: She admitted that she made a mistake_

 `verb+ing` should be used when the subject is already understood.

_Ex: He enjoys reading_

## to+verb Vs. for+verb+ing

`to+verb` is used to describe why an action was taken. 

_Ex: He shouldnâ€™t have joined the army to impress people._

`for+verb` describes a reason or justification for something. 

_Ex: HE is known for singing beautifully_
