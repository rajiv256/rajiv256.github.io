I have learnt from experience and reading (too few than I am supposed to) papers, I've realized/others have made me realize that the secret to good writing is proliferating your cache of verbs. Not to mention the correct usage of prepositions. (I can never tell if I should write secret _to_ good writing or secret _for_ good writing.)

## that+<verb> vs. <verb>-ing 

- `that + verb` should be used while introducing a new subject or before a new clause that requires qualifying a specific action being referred to a subject. Simply put `that + verb` to qualify an action. 

_Ex: She admitted that she made a mistake_

- `verb+ing` should be used when the subject is already understood. 

_Ex: He enjoys reading_
