## Papers

@Zhang2021-ta

### Main points

-   Nucleic acid therapeutics are third most emerging technology and
    substrate after small-molecules and antibodies.

-   Simple, fast, and cost-effective.

-   RNA therapeutics doesn't induce mutagenesis such as DNA does.

-   Conditional execution have not been figured out. Most DNA/RNA
    therapeutics are delivered to their action site. Lipid Nano
    particles (LNPs) are also a delivery vehicle.

-   Alternative strategy is to enhance specificity by incorporating
    computing into the circuitsâ€”triggers as 'input', programming
    modalities as the 'transducer' and the output as the 'effector'.
